In this part, we will give detailed descriptions for running certain softwares.

There are various softwares that have already been installed in our cluster, and all these softwares are made avaialbe through enviroment module system, `spack` and Lmod in our particular case.

Available softwares and packages can be shown by `spack find`.

Available python packages can be shown by `spack load intel-parallel-studio % intel; pip list`.

For softwares not available in the cluster, users can send request to cluster adminstrators or try to compile and install it on their own home directory. If the users believe such software is of general interest to other users, we recommend them to contact the administrator and install the software to make it available in system range.

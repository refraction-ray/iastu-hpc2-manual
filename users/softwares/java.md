Change the `CLASSPATH`, `export CLASSPATH=.:$CLASSPATH` ,somehow it doesn't auto include the current dir (possiblely due to conda env entangled with intelpython).   Or use `java -cp . Hello` to correctly load Hello.class. [classpath overriding and specifying](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26246436/is-the-current-path-in-the-classpath-by-default). Actually `spack load intel-parallel-studio %intel` auto change the CLASSPATH env var but no current dir is kept as class path!

In this part, you will be introduced to the basic workflow that user should follow in HPC2. Including how to connect, how to uploads and downloads files, how the storage works, how are the hardware specs, how to use softwares in general and how to submit jobs.

Every user should carefully review this part, since every HPC has its own style and experience from other HPC may not guarantee the best practice here. 

However, even in the basic section of the documentation, we assume the users have some basic knowledge on Linux, including basic CLI commands, shell environments and scripts, text editors like vim and so on. If you are not familiar with Linux, please refer to general leanring resource on Linux. (For example, the users should have some familiarity with the first four parts of [this tutorial](http://cn.linux.vbird.org/linux_basic/linux_basic.php) at least, otherwise learning some general Linux stuff is always a good first move.)

Anyway, google is always your first choice for help when you have troubles working on Linux or reading the documentation. Basically, you can learn everything of the world from google. Try to use it as often as possible. For problems relevant with the cluster that you cannot solve by yourself, you can also email the administrator for help. 

Bottom line: never type any command you have no idea of in Linux environment. Even though normal user don't have sudo permission, some really bad commands may cause troubles. Therefore, to use the HPC cluster, you at least should know every line you have typed in the terminal.

## SSH client

To connet the cluster for tasks and computation, users should use SSH clients. Such clients are shipped with MacOS and Linux distributions by default. If users use Window, we strongly recommended WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux prrovided by Windows 10) for developing environment as well as ssh clients. Besides, there are various ssh client softwares in windows, like PuTTY or XSHELL.

In this part, I would keep some notes on tools or softwares that I haven't fully determined to merge into the main workflow on HPC2, it is kept for possible future technology selections.

## OpenHPC

[Official repo](https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/), *note it has a github wiki page*

[Cool wiki list on what tools they contained](https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/wiki/Component-List-v1.3.7), and possible an important list of softwares that might be useful for HPC in general.

Not a valid option for debian?

## Singularity

*a runtime container*

[site](http://singularity.lbl.gov/)

## Modules

[site](http://modules.sourceforge.net/)

Not a fan of this due to the language it utilized.

## Lmod
